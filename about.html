    <div class="title">The female nipple is overly sexualized in our current society. My partner wanted to express that all nipples are the same, if nipples are cropped out from human breast then there is no reason for the female nipple to be sexualized. When comparing male and female nipples there is absolutely no difference. I wanted to capture that exact same thought with my project showing that nipples are the same. As people say free the nipple.</div>
